Variables

To define a variable in python simply write it name and its initial value
"""

var1 = "Hello"
variable = 5
variable2 = '5'
jjAbrams = 5.0

""""
Variables are runtime storage for your application, when the application runs these variables
are set, when the application closes the variable's value is lost.

We can also define variables without a value initially.
